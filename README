" About:
"
"  How often do you forget which keys you should use to select/modify strings
"  in the ' or " or in other pairs? I often use viw/ciw instead of vi'/vi" for
"  the first time because it easier for my fingers (but after that I remember
"  about vi'). This script allows you always use the same shortcut for all
"  cases. When you want to select string in the ' use viv. Do you want to
"  select all in the '()'? Use viv. All in the '[]'? Use viv.
"
" How it works:
"
"  Script searches first unpair symbol from the left of the current cursor
"  position and than runs target command with this symbol. You can use i or a
"  modifiers for commands too.
"
" Available commands:
"
"  vi* -> viv
"  va* -> vav
"  ci* -> civ
"  ca* -> cav
"  di* -> div
"  da* -> dav
"  ya* -> yiv
"  ya* -> yav
"  Where * is in <, >, ", ', `, (, ), [, ], {, } or t as tag
"
"  NOTE: After v* commands you also can press v again and script extends selection
"  to the next pairs.
